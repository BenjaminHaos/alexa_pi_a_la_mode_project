# Alexa Pi Arduino ir Remote

A basic example for making your echo turn on your tv.

Say "Alexa, turn on the television" and have the TV turn on.

# HOW?

An Alexa signals to a Raspberry pi that in turn sends signal to an Arduino that flashes an ir led to turn on your tv.

# WHO?

Anyone who has an Amazon Echo, a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino Uno, a ir led, a resistor, and some wires.

# WHY?

Because i can't find my remote and it'd be nice if the tv was on while i was looking for it.

# WEN?

Right now. Takes a few hours at the most to setup.

# WER?

In your home.
